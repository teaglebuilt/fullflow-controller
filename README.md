Controls kubernetes from mutating requests / responses at the kubernetes api.
Giving event driven capabilities off of ordinary procedures. As of right now, looking to test the ability to seperate logic from the fullflow application to synchronize the enterprise / kernel gateway with the kubernetes pods.
